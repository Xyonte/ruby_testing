Test First Ruby
==========

See [testfirst.org/learn_ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby#install) for more information about how this will work.

Basically, you will fork this repository and then clone it onto your local computer.  
For each of the exercises, you will run the specs from the command line to see
what tests you need to make pass (see the link above for more info about how
to do that).  You will then write the Ruby code that makes
those tests pass and move on to the next exercise.

When you're done, push your changes to your forked repo and then submit a pull
request to [the main repo](https://github.com/vikingeducation/learn_ruby/) so we
can see your solutions and verify that you've completed the exercises.
